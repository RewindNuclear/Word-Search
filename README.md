File Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first line of the file will have a single positive integer k, representing the number of test cases in the file. Then there 
will be k groups of inputs representing k different test cases. 
The  first  line  of  a  test  case  consists  of  3  integers,  M,  N,  and  S.  Here  M  =  number  of  rows  in  the  matrix,  N  =  numer  of 
columns in the matrix, and S = number of words you need to find from this matrix. 
Then M lines represent the rows input characters, were each line has N characters saperated by space. 
After M lines, there will be S lines of words. You need to find these words in the matrix. 
Similarly, K test cases will be provided in the above format.
